# Question

"""
Forward pass
Let's have something resembling more a neural network. The computational graph has been given below. You are going to initialize 3 large random tensors, and then do the operations as given in the computational graph. The final operation is the mean of the tensor, given by torch.mean(your_tensor).

100 XP
Initialize random tensors x, y and z, each having shape (1000, 1000).
Multiply x with y, putting the result in tensor q.
Do an elementwise multiplication of tensor z with tensor q, putting the results in f
